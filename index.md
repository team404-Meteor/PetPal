## Welcome to the GitHub Page for PetPal

### Introduction
PetPal is a Meteor Application made for the Meteor Hackathon 2021.

### Overview
PetPal is an application built to help prevent animals from the negative impacts of living in an animal shelter. There are many reasons why pet parents need to separate from their beloved companions, such as: financial stresses, behavioral issues, housing concerns and other personal circumstances.

PetPal wants to provide pet parents an opportunity to rehome their animals, as well as provide a useful tool to those who are seeking a new companion. Our hope is that PetPal reduces the number of animals admitted into shelters, while decreasing the number of euthanizations due to overcrowding and understaffed and overworked rescue professionals. Behavioral issues that commonly develop in the shelter include anxiety, which leads to aggression towards people or animals, and fear, which causes leash reactivity and barrier-related aggression. Some other common problems include the emergence of destructive behavior and house training regression.

#### Current Issues with Existing Adoption or Rehoming Applications
- Animals must enter a shelter in order to be adopted.
- People may find it difficult to navigate confusing websites such as Craigslist.
- Difficult to communicate over Craigslist.

#### Benefits
While the current method of adopting or rehoming a pet can involve bringing your beloved companion to the shelter, PetPal offers a better solution. Adopting and rehoming through a Peer-to-Peer service. Have an open line of communication with those looking to surrender and those look to adopt pets.
