I sit and give good eye contact and have learned to walk better on leash all through treats and calm, consistent training.\n\nThat's what I would like in my new home - calm, consistent training (and some treats). :-)\n\nI can be initially slow to warm up to people and prone to escape if not handled securely; hence why that consistent training and treats is so important. ;-) And within a day or so, I will warm up and learn my routine so fast!\n\nI have met some dogs I was a little unsure about, and other easy-going, very social puppies that I have done great with. The key to my heart, and to being my best-matched home, is understanding I might start out needing more patience and initial routine than your average pet.

Roxy became my BFF gal pal a couple years ago. We're back here because our guardians moved out of the country and were not able to take us with them. We're children friendly and hope to find a home soon!To see all the available rabbits at SaveABunny, please visit http://www.saveabunny.org/rabbits/allavailable",

      "description": "Larry and Blanca are two peas in a pod, and they enjoy sharing a big salad every day! These two house buns are very much in love and are looking to find a home together. Larry is inquisitive and likes to see what you're up to. Blanca is well mannered and laid back. Larry and Blanca are experienced house rabbits with years of indoor house-living under their belts. They have lived with older children in the past. They would make a great pair for anyone prepared for the joys of bunny companionship! Call our Healdsburg campus at 707-431-3386 to find out more about this soft and sweet duo. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAll Humane Society of Sonoma County rabbits are companion house rabbits. They live indoors only and cage free- living in a pen or free-roam in the home. This lets them live much longer, happier lives! Indoor rabbits can live 12+ years and require a lot of time and commitment. In return they offer years of love and companionship!
