However, they have learned that I LOVE TO LEARN - and treats motivate me to learn all sorts of tricks! I sit and give good eye contact and have learned to walk better on leash all through treats and calm, consistent training.\n\nThat's what I would like in my new home - calm, consistent training (and some treats). :-)\n\nI can be initially slow to warm up to people and prone to escape if not handled securely; hence why that consistent training and treats is so important. ;-) And within a day or so, I will warm up and learn my routine so fast!\n\nI have met some dogs I was a little unsure about, and other easy-going, very social puppies that I have done great with. The key to my heart, and to being my best-matched home, is understanding I might start out needing more patience and initial routine than your average pet. Watching me learn and grow is so rewarding!",

Justin and Lance are brothers and wouldn't mind going home together. \n\n\n\nAll Humane Society of Sonoma County rabbits are companion house rabbits. They live indoors only and cage free- living in a pen or free-roam in the home. This lets them live much longer, happier lives! Indoor rabbits can live 12+ years and require a lot of time and commitment. In return they offer years of love and companionship!
